Tile Map Creation Tool

Tilez Creator is a tile map building tool designed for HTML5 browsers.  The goal behind it was to provide a simple user interface for creating large tile map game worlds like Super Mario, Zelda, or other similar games.  Then allowing export to as many languages and libraries as possible, which will always be expanding.

It uses a canvas as its central operating tool, the canvas will draw the tilemap that the user is creating based on the size of each tile, the zoom of the canvas, and the amount of tiles that the user is trying to add to the screen.  Using various html inputs the interface provides easy access to each of these options.

Giving something to the idea of layers, the user can optionally toggle different maps to be displayed at one time.  For example, when the user wants to create the collision tile layer, as well as the background picture tile layer at the same time, both will be displayed; otherwise optionally one or the other, or neither.

This idea was generated for the sake of having to enter in countless amounts of numbers into arrays just to get the right positioning of tiles and all the time wasted that could be spent on something much more revolutionary.  Another reason was to remove the need to download a program to do the exact same job.  With cross browser compatibility, this tool can be run on the internet anywhere at any time, hopefully eventually even with a mobile interface to allow tilemap creation on the go.
